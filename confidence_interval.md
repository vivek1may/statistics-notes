# Confidence Interval

Different samples (sampled from true population) give different results. 
There is a variablity in outcomes and statistics.

A confidence interval provides a range of values that will capture the true population value a certain percentage of the time. You determine the level of confidence, but it is generally set at 90%, 95%, or 99%. Confidence intervals use the variability of your data to assess the precision or accuracy of your estimated statistics

**Sample Size and Variablity** 

The precision of your statistics depends on your sample size and variability. A larger sample size or lower variability will result in a tighter confidence interval with a smaller margin of error. A smaller sample size or a higher variability will result in a wider confidence interval with a larger margin of error. The level of confidence also affects the interval width. If you want a higher level of confidence, that interval will not be as tight. A tight interval at 95% or higher confidence is ideal.
