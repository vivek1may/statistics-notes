# Hypothesis testing

## 6 steps for hypothesis testing
1. Specify the null hypothesis
2. Specify the alternate hypothesis
3. Set the Significance level (alpha)
4. Calculate the p-value
5. Draw to conclusion

[Interest in disproving the null hypothesis]

1. Specify the null hypothesis

The null hypothesis (H0) is a statement of no effect, relationship, or difference between two or more groups or factors.  In research studies, a researcher is usually interested in disproving the null hypothesis.

2. Specify the alternate hyposthesis

The alternative hypothesis (H1) is the statement that there is an effect or difference.  This is usually the hypothesis the researcher is interested in proving

3. Set the Significance Level (a)

The significance level (denoted by the Greek letter alphaâ€” a) is generally set at 0.05.  This means that there is a 5% chance that you will accept your alternative hypothesis when your null hypothesis is actually true. The smaller the significance level, the greater the burden of proof needed to reject the null hypothesis, or in other words, to support the alternative hypothesis

4. Calculate the p-value

The p-value describes the probability of obtaining a sample statistic as or more extreme by chance alone if your null hypothesis is true.  This p-value is determined based on the result of your test statistic.  Your conclusions about the hypothesis are based on your p-value and your significance level.

5. Draw to conclusion

P-value <= significance level (a) => Reject your null hypothesis in favor of your alternative hypothesis.  Your result is statistically significant.

P-value > significance level (a) => Fail to reject your null hypothesis.  Your result is not statistically significant.

Hypothesis testing is not set up so that you can absolutely prove a null hypothesis.  Therefore, when you do not find evidence against the null hypothesis, you fail to reject the null hypothesis. When you do find strong enough evidence against the null hypothesis, you reject the null hypothesis.  Your conclusions also translate into a statement about your alternative hypothesis.
